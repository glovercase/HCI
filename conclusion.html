        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Through our analysis we found two conclusions.  Firstly the tracking of distance had only a slight variance between the dedicated fitness tracker - Garmin watch, and “My Track” iPhone application.  This is a big take away as it shows that even an older iPhone model such as the 5s can track as well as the Garmin Watch where the primary function is to record fitness data.  We tested by placing the phone in different places on the body and it didn’t hinder the tracking of distance.  This is a very useful discovery, as placing a phone anywhere on the body has no impact in its tracking of distances.

The other conclusion from our analysis and findings was that the Garmin Watch was a little more favoured than carrying a phone while running or walking.  While both devices scored high in the participants comfort levels, the Garmin scored generally higher with scores of 5’s and 4’s.  The questions we asked the participants also pointed to the Garmin Watch being more comfortable as they didn’t have to worry about where the phone is while they go about with their exercise.

Overall, we have found that people prefer the design of the Garmin, as they would not have to worry about it while exercising.  Comfortability is high with the Garmin and moderately high with the iPhone.  In future designs of fitness products, the location on where it would be placed on a person’s body does not hinder the accuracy of tracking distance.  This was proven as an older iPhone was able to keep up with a dedicated fitness tracker in the Garmin watch, regardless of the position kept on the body.

        <h3>Improvements that could have been made:</h3>
        <p>We conducted our test on a very few amount of people.  This was due to the weather being a little bad on the day and also the timing of the day.  We would've like to have more participants run the test, to get more data that we could have compared.  Being limited to the small sample size felt like we did not get a complete picture of the comparability of the Garmin and “My Track” iPhone application.  In the future, more participants would have led us to get more answers, maybe leading to a bigger variance in comfort and also the accuracy of distance travelled.

Another improvement we wanted was the tracking of distance at multiple points while on the run.  Initially we thought that both the application and Garmin would do this automatically.  This was something we hoped to test, but was set back once we extracted the data and found it was not the case.  If we were able to do this, we could measure the accuracy of the iPhone in more detail against the Garmin.

One last improvement that could be made is to run the experiment on a running track.  By doing so we would have an accurate measurement that we could compare both the Garmin and iPhone application to.  We could also test the accuracy of capturing meters travelled over various distances, e.g. 100m, 400m, 1km, 2km.  This would give us a idea if the iPhone can accurately track distances over longer distances while placing it on various parts of the body.
