          <p>Our initial plan changed quite significantly, we received a phd paper from Arda to implement an algorithm that calculates the accuracy of a device by CM instead of M. Unfortunately our group was unable to understand the math formulas as they are at a PHD level. With the short time frame to get the assignment done we changed our plan to focus more on the participants experience exercising with a device and comparing the results of each. However we decided to continue the experiment by looking at where the user wore the phone and if they preferred the that over the garmin watch. Then looking at the accuracy of the phone being placed in that position.

During the process of the extracting the data we were hoping to extract the latitude and longitude coordinates to then see the differences between the devices. Unfortunately the export csv file only exported the final distance, time, average speed. We were still able to compare this data and make a structured opinion on the usability of the device.

          This assignment has been challenging in more ways than one. To start with it took a long time to figure out what we were going to research and analyse. This lead to my idea of contacting Arda hoping we would be able to test one of their devices and relating that to HCI. After a few email and phone calls we went down the track with the research paper that they had but after reading the research paper it was way over our heads mathematically we asked fellow pairs and there was no chance in understanding the math in the algorithm in a few weeks. This lead to our team to explore a slightly different angle.
        </p>
          <p>
It has been a long time since I have done an experiment and I really enjoyed thinking in that way, it was a nice change from programming. Our team worked really well together and we all got a long. It was really fun getting out of the ‘classroom’ to do the experiment. We made a few mistakes along the way and learnt from it. Going into the experiment we didn’t know what data we would receive when exporting to a .csv and it was unfortunate that it did not provide more data to analyse to make a stronger opinion. Because we could not see or touch during the experiment it has given me a better understanding of what new technology could do for humans and how they can interact with it. I believe that when sensors improve they will be able to track and improve how humans move between each joint and communicate all sorts of data such as body temp to let you know if you are too hot or cold.
        </p>
        <p>
As far as HCI for fitness purposes cell phones are a pain to carry on the body and personally I don’t like wearing watches when exercising some of the participants also found this which leads to an idea of having a device that is very light and not restricting on the body. I believe this is where fitness devices will head. As far as the technology of gps tracking goes it will keep getting better and be able to give more accurate information it is exciting to see what is yet to come with HCI. I am privileged to be amongst testing designing and researching such technology.

          <p>This was the first usability experiment / test I have done.  This experience that this assessment for Applied Human Computer Interaction provided was a unique one.  From having to come up with our own question, coming up with an experiment for our question, to finally conducting the test and recording the results was a very knowledgeable and fun experience.  Over the course of the assessment we had to keep changing our plan.  We were originally planning to compare an algorithm received from a company, with a fitness device to check for accuracy.  But we found the maths to be too hard for us to make any sense of it as it was at a much higher level than what we were used too.   Even when capturing our data and exporting it for analysis we found that we did not get all of the results we wanted and thus had to modify our question a little.  Constantly having to change our plans and question was a little frustrating, but was still a great learning experience as we had to keep it in line with the human computer interaction (HCI) aspect.  This HCI aspect of the assessment helped us think on how the two devices, Garmin and iPhone 5s, have applied design principles with their devices.  For me personally I thought that the ease of having an application on a phone would be better than a dedicated fitness tracker.  But when I actually tried the Garmin out myself, I found that it was much better design wise as I did not have to hold my phone in my hand or pocket and worry about it.
          </p>
          <p>
Moreover, when analysing our data I was quite disappointed that we were not able to capture more observations and more detailed statistics.  I had wished we were able to get more participants and also able to track certain distances over the total distance travelled in the test.  Since we did not get all the statistics we had wanted, I felt that the analysis may have been a little underwhelming.  I am also taking a statistics paper and had wished to apply some of my learning in this HCI experiment.
          </p>
          <p>
The assessment itself was a pretty good experience.  Having to formulate our own experiments was fun and different to the other assessments I have done while at AUT.  My team was also very good as we were all on track and actively contributing to get work done.  Overall the Applied HCI paper helped me to understand human computer interaction in design a lot more.  As I hope to be a software developer in the future, and also while I am currently doing my R&D project, it gave me a new understanding of what to be aware of while designing and programming any application.  One of this is whether an application on a phone or a dedicated device would be more usable.  It has also made me think of why the application is needed, and how the user will use the application.  I hope this will expand on my creativity when designing applications in the future.

		  <p>What I have learnt from this HCI research is that time consuming plays an important role in planning project. At the beginning of this project, we formed team quickly. However, we were suffering from picking topics for our project. We spent almost 3 weeks seeking the suitable topic. There are a lot of points need to be considered to fit the requirement of project. The planning and execution sessions of project took us two weeks to finish. On the other hand, we must coordinate each member to attend test session and assign tasks to complete following analysis. Different members have different course schedules, it is hard to find a proper date to do the research together, we mostly work in the evening.
          </P><P>On the analysis of data, I am disappointed in myself for not taking much tasks in this part. I know I did bad in mathematics, I discussed this with my mates and I am happy they understand me.
          </P><P>Another thing I have learnt from HCI research is being compromised if it is needed. In progress of developing website, we picked a template before we start the test session. Later, I took the role of developing website. Because the lack of PHP knowledge, it is hard for me to modify the website. So, I suggested to use the template on wix.com to present our work. However, it is not being fully accepted by my group. Because the deadline of submitting is so close, I do not want to waste time on arguing this unnecessary point. I agreed on modifying the first template we picked together. As a part of group, sometimes it is necessary to be compromised to help the project to be successful. It is not mean own opinions are unimportant. Comparing to the whole benefit of group, self-opinions are not so important under this situation. I am happy to keep my opinions and agree on other available choice if most people agree with that. After all, I am part of a team, I should consider the benefit of whole team as the highest priority.
          </P><P>After participating in this research, I am aware of I need to study more about HCI to understand this course. Different from normal courses in AUT, HCI course provides us an opportunity to learn from practices. I learn as I participate in researching.

          <p>Throughout this assignment we changed what we set out to do. Despite this setback we were able to find a way to conduct an experiment which also relates to HCI. We obtained data that helped us find out how accurate the Garmin watch is and the “My Track” application on Iphone 5s. We discovered that the readings from a run conducted around the same track by 5 different participants provided fairly similar results. This proved that no matter where you placed the phone on the body of a person the readings would not provide an exaggerated result from the garmin watch. Overall this experiment showed that a person is able to obtain data of their run accurately from either method. From the experiment we see that the garmin watch is favoured for its comfortability where as the phone provides more options for where to put the phone to a person’s liking. But overall both devices are accurate in their readings.</p>
